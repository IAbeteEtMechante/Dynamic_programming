<!-- GENERAL CONCEPTS -->
## General Concepts

### Memoization

### Bottom up

### Push DP
Kind of easier to implement, we just try to see how the current value contributes to future values, according to transitions.


<!-- WHEN TO USE DP -->
## When to use DP?

If there is no plausible state to store the answer, it probably isn't DP.

The way to determine if you can use DP is just....to check if you can use DP.

When you are trying to solve a problem you just try different directions. With experience you get a better intuition on which direction is more likely to work than others.

<!-- TIPS -->
## Tips

Often it is better to start by finding the transitions. Then find the base cases. Because it is easy to know how many bases cases you need once you have all the transitions.

<!-- LIST OF PROBLEMS WITH SOLUTIONS -->
## List of problems with solutions

Here is the list of DP problems on Codeforces:

Solutions to problems are in this repo. All solutions in this repo have been "Approved" on Codeforces.
